# ContEx Demonstration

  * Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/mindok/contex-samples.git`
  * `cd contex-samples`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Notes
Currently this demo is pointing to the github rep for the :contex dependency - the ContEx codebase is likely to be unstable as per the [Readme in the ContEx package repo](https://github.com/mindok/contex)
